# My attempt on the GResearch Financial Forecasting Challenge

Feb 2018 - Apr 15th 2018

The file `Final_GResearch_RMD.html` is my notebook that documents my experience in my first data science competition. The extra models notebook was made for a final assignment for a course. The `.Rmd` files are the files used to create the `.html` files. I used the R programming language for this challenge, but I switched to Python around May 2018.
